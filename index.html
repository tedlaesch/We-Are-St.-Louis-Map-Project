              <b>We Are St. Louis</b>
                <br><p><i>We Are St. Louis</i> is an online public history and storytelling project designed by a team of dedicated scholar-activists at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.</p>
                <p><i>We Are St. Louis</i> first aims to serve as a publicly accessible, curated living digital collection that illuminates the network of oppressive systems in the region, while also lifting up the social change, creation, and joy that has long been undertaken by St. Louisans. The city of St. Louis and the broader region has a complex history of violence and oppression, but also a rich history of activism and resistance, from the Dred Scott decision to the Ferguson Uprising.</p>
                <p>While there are other archives, historical sites, and scholarly projects that represent some of St. Louis’ past, present, and future, there is no publicly accessible virtual home in which scholars, community members and general visitors can engage in stories and analysis of St. Louis’ struggles and strengths. <i>We Are St. Louis</i> aims to fill that gap and to amplify and support often unheard or unarchived local stories, histories, and perspectives of St. Louisans in the process.</p>

              <b>Moderation</b>
                <br><p>Posts to We Are St. Louis are moderated by a small group of volunteers before they appear publically on the map. This to ensure no hate speech, spam or breaches of anonymity are added to the site. </p>
                <p>Depending on the amount of posts that have been made over the past few months, there may become a backlog and we are doing our best to publish posts as quickly as we can. If you see anything you feel should be removed, or would like something you posted to be deleted, please contact us!</p>
